If you want to see nicely structured release notes, you can create a `release.yml` file under the `.github` folder with the following content:

```yaml
# .github/release.yml

changelog:
  exclude:
    labels:
      - ignore-for-release
    authors:
      - octocat
  categories:
    - title: Breaking Changes ðŸ› 
      labels:
        - Semver-Major
        - breaking-change
    - title: Exciting New Features ðŸŽ‰
      labels:
        - Semver-Minor
        - enhancement
    - title: Other Changes
      labels:
        - "*"
```
